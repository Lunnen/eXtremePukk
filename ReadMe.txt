Authors:      Andreas Hansson , Andreas Lönnholm , Tommi Toivanen, Karl Wallenius.
Type:         game/action
Version:      1.0.
Requires:     Java or Processing (www.processing.org).
Architecture: x86/PPC


This is a game we made as a project for our university course "Data System Management" in Hässleholm, Sweden.
We have used processing to develop it, made the graphics and sound samples ourselves.
The project time has been from November 2008 to January 2009.
This program is now released under GNU General Public License.




INSTALL:
The Java applet runs within a browser that supports Java, just open the index.html.
Processing is downloadable from it's website, and you can find installation instructions from there.
In addition you need to install the  oscP5-plugin, which we have used for network, found with instructions at http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/ .
When installed, just open the eXtremeBall.pde, which is the main executable.



USAGE:
Should be quite self-evident.
For controlling the ball:
 UpKeyHost='w'; DownKeyHost='s'; LeftKeyHost='a'; RightKeyHost='d';
 UpKeyClient='u'; DownKeyClient='j'; LeftKeyClient='h'; RightKeyClient='k';

The IP-adresses needs to be set in the code for now.


CREDs:

Martin Nilsson for the project tutoring.
Jesper "Joppe" Wilhelmsson for tips and hints how to bypass programming problems.
